## Use of Generative AI

This project explicitly does not allow any contributions that were generated in whole or in-part by large language models (LLMs), chatbots, or image generation systems. This ban includes tools, including but not limited to Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney, or Devin AI.

This policy covers all parts of the project, including, but not limited to code, documentation, issues, artworks, comments, discussions, pull requests, and any other contributions to Squishy, without exception.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also recommended to avoid any and all AI tools when asking questions about Squishy,
> prefer the documentation when available, as well as things such as the discussion forum, or IRC channel.
> These tools often fabricate plausible sounding information that is entirely incorrect, or often subtly
> incorrect and pass it off with confidence, thus misleading.
